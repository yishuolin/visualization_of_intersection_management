# Visualization of Graph-Based Intersection Management

### Final Project for Introduction to Intelligent Vehicles

In this project, we propose an online visualization platform for graph-based intersection management[[1]](#1). We implement the traﬀic animation and the visualization of timing conflict graph. We believe that the platform can motivate users to learn and help them understand the concept. While our work focus on 2x2 rectangular conflict zones, we hope it can be generalized in the future.

## Get Started
```bash
npm install
```

## Run in Development Mode
```bash
npm run start
```
Open `localhost:10922` to view the platform.
